      <h2>PC Hardware</h2>
      <p>
        My favorite part about the PC Hardware Course is how it revealed the way
        computers work. Before this class, anything to do with the internal
        components of a computer was a mystery to me, and it seemed like magic
        how they could work. However, my least favorite part of the course is
        the memorization of all fancy names for the different parts and their
        functions. Overall, it's a good course that I learn a lot from.

        <h2>PC Hardware</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite part about the PC Hardware Course is how it revealed the
          way computers work. Before this class, anything to do with the
          internal components of a computer was a mystery to me, and it seemed
          like magic how they could work. However, my least favorite part of the
          course is the memorization of all fancy names for the different parts
          and their functions. Overall, it's a good course that I learn a lot
          from.

        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite part about the Web Development Course is how it taught me
          the fundamentals of building websites. Before this class, I had no
          idea how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript worked together to create a
          functional website, and now, I can make a basic website with HTML and
          some CSS. However, my least favorite part is the repeatedly using
          similar code snippets for different projects, which can be tedious
          sometimes. Overall, it's a great course that has helped me begin to
          build a good understanding of web development, and I'm excited to
          learn more about CSS and JavaScript later on in the course.
